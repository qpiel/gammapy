Preview of some files from the upcoming Joint Crab paper:
https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/joint-crab

This will come in fall 2018.

For now, I just put the 1D extracted spectra for the four H.E.S.S. Crab run. The
script to generate these files from the DL3 files will be in the `joint_crab`
repo.

Those are being released at the moment:
