# Fermi 3FHL Galactic center dataset

This is a small Fermi-LAT dataset used for tutorials and tests in Gammapy. It is a small cutout for the Galactic center region from the 3FHL dataset (10 GeV to 2 TeV) from here: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-fermi-lat-data

In addition, the background models are taken from here:

The `gll_iem_v06_cutout.fits` is a small cutout from this file:
